What did I do this time?
    - Completed grep
    - Updated man with the new commands
    - Updated test cases for Directory
    - Updated test cases for Echo
    - Updated test cases for Cat

What do I plan to do now?
    - Think up test scenarios
    - Complete test cases
    - Update crcCards (as they became out of date as we were developing)

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Doing test cases are very tedious
