What did I do this time?
    - implemented new functionality to the Pwd class
    - Finished the man class

What do I plan to do now?
    - Think up test scenarios
    - Start test cases
    - Update all the crcCards (as they became out of date as we were developing)

Am I blocked on anything?
    - Doing test cases are very tedious
    - Limited knowledge of how testing in java works
