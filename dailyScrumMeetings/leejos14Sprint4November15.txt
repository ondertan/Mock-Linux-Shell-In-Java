What did I do last time?
	- Created an error class
	- Made cat accept multiple files of same directory
	- Added comments to new cat method


What do I plan to do now?
	- Fill in error class
	- Implement partial and full paths into class


Am I blocked on anything?
    - Making cat take partial and full paths
