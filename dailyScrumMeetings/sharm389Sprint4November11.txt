What did I do this time?
    - Attempted to add -r command to ls
    - Tried to implement displaying all ls subdirectories
    - Added pathchecker class
    - Implemented path checker class into ls

What do I plan to do now?
    - Fix the recursively display subdirectories
    - Add -r command to jshell
    - Debug ls
    - Add pathchecker to other classes

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Recursively displaying all subdirectories
