What did I do this time?
    - Coded most of ls class
    - Changed crc cards since we got rid of some classes
    - Still working on the echo class
    - Directory class renamed to tree class and finished
    - Assited in implementing hashtables into jshell

What do I plan to do now?
    - Adding hashtables to man class
    - Finish coding rest of man class
    - Assist on optimizing jshell
    - Debugging ls class
    - Continue working/assit on echo class

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Debugging the ls class(Still causing some errors)
	- Trying to find ways to add polymorphism to design
