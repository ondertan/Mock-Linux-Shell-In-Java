What did I do last time?
	- Add type contracts to echo class
	- Add type contracts to file class
	- Add type contracts to exit class
	- Add type contracts to cat class
	- Made echo more modular by splitting all the functions into seperate methods


What do I plan to do now?
	- Added error class
	- Add save command to echo


Am I blocked on anything?
    - Blocked on adding save command to echo
