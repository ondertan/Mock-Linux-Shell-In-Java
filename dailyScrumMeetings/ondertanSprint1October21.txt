What did I do last time?
    - considered the implementation of the overall shell
    - brainstormed ideas but the crcCards
    - Started on the tree class

What do I plan to do now?
    - Finish the tree class
    - work on new tasks for sprint 2
    - finalize the design portion, as there were some undecided parts among the group

Am I blocked on anything?
    - we are thinking of working off a tree, the idea needs to be smoothed out and the implementation of the tree needs to be perfected, have some issues with adding parents as of this moment
