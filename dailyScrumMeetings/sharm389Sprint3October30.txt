What did I do this time?
    - Still Coding ls(Had to restart after a huge mistake)
    - Refactoring some code for classes
    - Optimized Jshell
    - Created Sprint Backlog 3
    - Finished man class

What do I plan to do now?
    - Debugging mkdir and ls classes
    - Trying to implement an interface
    - Trying to incorporate inheritence into echo class
    - Debug cd class


Am I blocked on anything?
